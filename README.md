## Hi, I’m Annu 👋

**Indie Hacker · Early-stage Founder · Builder**

I’m a self-taught developer from India, learning by building and thinking deeply about products.  
I care about clarity, fundamentals, and shipping things that actually help — not chasing hype.

###  Currently Exploring & Building

**Nexra AI**  
An early-stage product idea focused on helping founders think more clearly about their startup ideas  
before committing time, money, or emotional energy.

What I’m doing right now:
- Clarifying the core problem and user persona  
- Talking to builders and collecting early feedback  
- Experimenting with product direction and positioning  

This stage is **early, iterative, and intentionally slow**.

---

###  What I’m Focused On

- Learning **product thinking & system design** by building in public  
- Developing **Data Analytics skills** (SQL, dashboards, insights)  
  to make better product and business decisions  
- Shipping small, meaningful improvements consistently  

I share honest progress, learnings, and doubts on  
→ **Twitter:** https://twitter.com/Annu66126617

###  Data Analytics (Learning in Public)

I’m building a foundation in analytics to support product validation and decision-making:

- SQL fundamentals & analytical thinking  
- Dashboarding & KPI storytelling (practice projects)  
- Translating raw data into clear insights
